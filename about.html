          Hello! Welcome to my blog. I am cp, a 16 years old student studying in Singapore.
          I got introduced to pen-testing during the winter break of 2019 when I stumbled upon a 15 hour course by "The Cyber Mentor".
          Before I knew it, I was half way through the course, taking notes and trying out machines.
          That sparked my interest for CTF challenges, and I soon started doing Hack The Box machines during my free time.
          Recently I decided to create a blog to store my writeups, so I could refer to them as personal notes in the future.
          I will be uploading writeups of machines mainly from Hack The Box in this blog, and I hope that I can carry on doing this.
          As my A-levels examination is in a year's time, I will not be uploading too frequently, but I will try my best.
          Thank you for reading my writeups and I hope that they were helpful!
          Sidenote: My Dad is awesome, and this will never be possible without him.
